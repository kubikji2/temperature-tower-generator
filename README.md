# Temperature Tower Generator

Utility for creating customizable temperature towers for filament temperature calibration. [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) is used for creating a model, [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/) is used to create gcode and [Python](https://www.python.org/) is used to coordinate the effort.

## Roadmap

### Openscad - Core model

This step will be implemented in `source/floor.scad` file.

- [ ] model basic slopes at two different angles with holes
- [ ] add bridging segment
- [ ] add stringing segment (two cones)
- [ ] add curvature segment
